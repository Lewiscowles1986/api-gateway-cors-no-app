# Example of using CORS via API-Gateway V1 and avoiding application knowledge of CORS

This uses API Gateway to wrap another service, so that API-Gateway can add a canned OPTIONS response. The idea is to then use this with API Gateway to add CORS headers as well

I Think I forgot to add the CORS headers.

To be improved!
